# HEAP-AND-HEAP-BASED-PRIORITY-QUEUES

Welcome to the Heap and Heap-based Priority Queues GitHub repository! Here, you will find highly efficient implementations of Heap and Heap-based Priority Queues.

These implementations are inspired by two of my favorite algorithm courses: MIT 6006 and PRINCETON Algorithm 1. They have been carefully crafted to provide optimal performance and reliability.

Feel free to explore the code snippets and leverage them to enhance your own projects. Whether you need to maintain a partially ordered binary tree or manage elements with varying levels of importance, these implementations have got you covered.

Contributions and feedback are highly encouraged. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to raise them. Together, let's build better algorithms and data structures!

Get ready to dive into the world of heaps and priority queues. Happy coding!
